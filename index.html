				<p> My name is Chloe! <br>
					I am a 3rd year Computer Science major at the University of California, Davis <br>
					This is my resume site where I post all the cool stuff I am learning to do! <br>
					My skills include C and C++ coding, along with hopefully some javascript coding. <br>
					I am also well versed in enviorment sciences because I am an indesicive motherfucker who likes making my life harder than it needs to be! <br>
					Aside from my OBVIOUS passions in computer science, I also enjoy //insert hobbies here// <br>
					I also want you to know that I am proto-type ABG in the making <br>
					I have over 500 confirmed raves and am trained in getting boba at 2 in the morning and dating men who wear exclusively adidas <br>
					You're fucking dead kiddo <br>
					I hope you enjoy your site!
